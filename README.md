# Space Invaders Knockoff

> NOTE: This has been a fun project I did while sitting in my recliner and watche TNG. I'm not a game developer, so this is a very basic game. I'm sure there are better ways to do this, but I'm happy with the result as I was getting aquianted with C again.


## Install & Run

You need to install the SDL2 libraries to compile this game. On Ubuntu, you can do this with the following command:

```sh
# apt install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-2.0-0 libsdl2-ttf-dev
$ make
$ ./space_invaders
```
